# Squid Mesh Workflow Authoring Usage Rules

## Workflow Shape

- Define workflows as compiled Elixir modules with `use SquidMesh.Workflow`.
- Use business names for triggers, steps, and transitions.
- Declare `version "..."` inside `workflow do` when operators need a stable
  human-readable definition label across deploys.
- Keep workflow branches, retries, waits, recovery routes, and manual gates in
  the workflow definition when operators need to understand them.
- Use `SquidMesh.Workflow.to_spec/1` and `SquidMesh.Workflow.validate_spec/1`
  when tooling needs a normalized data representation.
- Use `SquidMesh.Workflow.validate_spec/2` with `:action_registry` before
  trusting runtime-authored spec data that references executable actions.
- Use `SquidMesh.Workflow.EditorSpec` for visual-editor JSON round trips and
  draft graph previews. Do not treat editor preview data as an execution
  boundary.
- Do not activate runtime-authored workflows from request input until the host
  has resolved action keys through a host-owned registry and the runtime
  execution boundary supports that spec shape.

## Steps

- Prefer `use SquidMesh.Step` for custom steps.
- Use `SquidMesh.start_child_run/4` or `SquidMesh.start_child_run/5` only from
  native steps that receive `SquidMesh.Step.Context`.
- Provide a stable, storage-safe `:child_key` for every child run; treat it as
  the idempotency key for the parent run and parent step.
- Keep child workflow modules backend-neutral, the same as parent workflows.
- Return `{:ok, output}` for success.
- Return `{:error, reason}` for terminal failure governed by workflow routing.
- Return `{:retry, reason}` or `{:retry, reason, opts}` for retryable failure.
- Keep side-effect idempotency inside the step or host domain boundary.
- Use raw `Jido.Action` modules only for explicit interop.

## Data Mapping

- Use payload contracts for start input validation.
- Use step `input:` to select only the data a step needs.
- Use step `output:` to place returned data under stable keys.
- Use conditional transitions for inspectable routing decisions.
- Use `equals` for exact matches and `greater_than` or `less_than` for numeric
  threshold routing.
- Keep condition values JSON-safe so selected routes can be persisted.

## Manual And Long-Running Work

- Use `:pause` or `approval_step/2` for operator-controlled boundaries.
- Resolve manual gates through `resume/3`, `approve/3`, and `reject/3`.
- Use `:wait` for workflow-scale delays, not arbitrary timers.
- Prefer cron or host scheduling when the whole workflow should start later.

## Recovery

- Mark irreversible external side effects with `irreversible: true` or
  `compensatable: false`.
- Use `recovery: :compensation` or `recovery: :undo` on error transitions when
  the route has operational meaning.
- Treat child runs as separate replay, retry, cancellation, and inspection
  boundaries. Do not mutate already-run parent steps to simulate dynamic
  expansion.
- Do not rely on "this step should only run once" as the side-effect safety
  model.
