# Graph Inspection Contract

`SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph/2` returns a graph-oriented view of one durable
workflow run. Use it when a host app, CLI, dashboard, or visual workflow tool
needs nodes and edges instead of raw journal history.

The public API still returns structs:

```elixir
{:ok, graph} = SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph(run_id)
```

Use `SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection.to_map/1` at the host boundary when a UI
needs a stable map payload:

```elixir
{:ok, graph} = SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph(run_id)
payload = SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection.to_map(graph)
```

That keeps existing struct callers compatible while giving UI serializers an
explicit shape.

## Top-Level Shape

The map shape is:

```elixir
%{
  run_id: "run_123",
  workflow: "Elixir.MyApp.Workflows.EmailReply",
  source: :read_model,
  status: :running,
  current_node_id: "draft_reply",
  current_node_ids: ["draft_reply"],
  terminal?: false,
  nodes: [...],
  edges: [...],
  anomalies: []
}
```

Workflow modules are serialized with `Atom.to_string/1`, so Elixir modules use
the normal `"Elixir."` prefix. Persisted serialized workflow definitions keep
their stored string value.

`current_node_id` is the first active node for simple callers.
`current_node_ids` preserves parallel runnable nodes in dependency workflows.
`terminal?` is true when the run is in a terminal state such as `:completed`,
`:failed`, or `:cancelled`.

## Node Shape

Nodes represent workflow steps:

```elixir
%{
  id: "draft_reply",
  status: :running,
  current?: true,
  input: nil,
  output: nil,
  error: nil,
  recovery: nil,
  transition: nil,
  manual_state: nil,
  attempts: []
}
```

Node status values are:

- `:waiting` - no runnable work has been recorded for the node
- `:pending` - work is visible or scheduled
- `:running` - a worker has an active claim
- `:retrying` - a failed attempt scheduled another try
- `:paused` - the node is waiting for manual intervention
- `:completed` - durable terminal step success exists
- `:failed` - durable terminal step failure exists

By default, inputs, outputs, errors, manual state, and attempt details are nil
or empty because they can contain host-domain data. Request details explicitly:

```elixir
{:ok, graph} = SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph(run_id, include_history: true)
payload = SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection.to_map(graph)
```

With history enabled, a node can include fields such as:

```elixir
%{
  id: "review_draft",
  status: :paused,
  current?: true,
  manual_state: %{step: "review_draft", kind: :approval},
  attempts: [%{attempt_number: 1, status: :completed}],
  output: %{drafts: [%{subject: "hello"}]}
}
```

Host apps should still authorize and redact this payload before exposing it
outside trusted operator surfaces.

## Edge Shape

Edges represent transitions or dependencies:

```elixir
%{
  id: "fetch_emails:ok:draft_reply",
  from: "fetch_emails",
  to: "draft_reply",
  type: :transition,
  status: :selected,
  selected?: true,
  skipped?: false,
  pending?: false,
  blocked?: false,
  outcome: :ok,
  condition: nil,
  recovery: nil
}
```

Edge status values are:

- `:selected` - durable step state proves this path was taken
- `:skipped` - a sibling path or terminal outcome won
- `:pending` - the source step or dependency has not terminally resolved
- `:blocked` - a dependency failed before this edge could become runnable

Conditional transition edges include their condition and deterministic ids:

```elixir
%{
  id: "classify:ok:auto_approve:condition:0",
  from: "classify",
  to: "auto_approve",
  type: :transition,
  outcome: :ok,
  condition: %{path: [:routing, :decision], equals: "auto"},
  status: :selected,
  selected?: true,
  skipped?: false,
  pending?: false,
  blocked?: false
}
```

Dependency workflows use dependency edges:

```elixir
%{
  id: "load_invoice:dependency:send_email",
  from: "load_invoice",
  to: "send_email",
  type: :dependency,
  outcome: nil,
  status: :pending,
  selected?: false,
  skipped?: false,
  pending?: true,
  blocked?: false
}
```

## Compatibility

The graph map contract is intended for host UI and tooling integration. Squid
Mesh may add optional fields in future releases, but the existing field names,
identifier semantics, node statuses, edge statuses, and default detail redaction
are stable compatibility points.

If the workflow module can no longer be loaded, Squid Mesh still returns any
durable node state it can infer from the run. `edges` is empty in that degraded
state because topology belongs to the workflow definition.

The default payload does not include claim tokens, storage configuration,
adapter internals, process identifiers, or raw journal entries.
