## Formatter Setup

Squid Mesh exports formatter rules for workflow DSL calls. Host apps can import
them from their `.formatter.exs`:

```elixir
[
  import_deps: [:squid_mesh],
  inputs: ["{mix,.formatter}.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}"]
]
```

## Define A Workflow

Workflows are Elixir modules that `use SquidMesh.Workflow` and declare:

- one trigger
- one payload contract
- one or more steps
- transitions between steps
- optional dependency-based `after: [...]` joins on steps that wait for other work
- optional retry policy on the steps that own side effects
- optional recovery markers for irreversible or non-compensatable side effects

```elixir
defmodule Billing.Workflows.PaymentRecovery do
  use SquidMesh.Workflow

  workflow do
    trigger :payment_recovery do
      manual()

      payload do
        field :account_id, :string
        field :invoice_id, :string
        field :attempt_id, :string
        field :gateway_url, :string
      end
    end

    step :load_invoice, Billing.Steps.LoadInvoice
    step :wait_for_settlement, :wait, duration: 5_000
    step :log_recovery_attempt, :log,
      message: "Invoice loaded, checking gateway status",
      level: :info
    step :check_gateway_status, Billing.Steps.CheckGatewayStatus,
      retry: [max_attempts: 5, backoff: [type: :exponential, min: 1_000, max: 30_000]]
    step :notify_customer, Billing.Steps.NotifyCustomer

    transition :load_invoice, on: :ok, to: :wait_for_settlement
    transition :wait_for_settlement, on: :ok, to: :log_recovery_attempt
    transition :log_recovery_attempt, on: :ok, to: :check_gateway_status
    transition :check_gateway_status, on: :ok, to: :notify_customer
    transition :notify_customer, on: :ok, to: :complete
  end
end
```

## Validate Workflow Specs

Compiled workflows can be exposed as normalized, serializable specs for tooling,
inspection, and planner rebuilds:

```elixir
{:ok, spec} = SquidMesh.Workflow.to_spec(Billing.Workflows.PaymentRecovery)
:ok = SquidMesh.Workflow.validate_spec(spec)
```

`validate_spec/1` validates the spec as data. It checks trigger shape, payload
fields, step modules, step options, transitions, dependency graphs, retry
policies, and entry metadata without starting a run and without coupling the
workflow to a specific delivery backend.

The spec is an Elixir data representation with atom keys and module atoms:

```elixir
%SquidMesh.Workflow.Spec{
  workflow: Billing.Workflows.PaymentRecovery,
  triggers: [
    %{
      name: :payment_recovery,
      type: :manual,
      config: %{},
      payload: [
        %{name: :account_id, type: :string, opts: []},
        %{name: :invoice_id, type: :string, opts: []}
      ]
    }
  ],
  payload: [
    %{name: :account_id, type: :string, opts: []},
    %{name: :invoice_id, type: :string, opts: []}
  ],
  steps: [
    %{name: :load_invoice, module: Billing.Steps.LoadInvoice, opts: []},
    %{
      name: :check_gateway_status,
      module: Billing.Steps.CheckGatewayStatus,
      opts: [retry: [max_attempts: 5]]
    }
  ],
  transitions: [
    %{from: :load_invoice, on: :ok, to: :check_gateway_status},
    %{from: :check_gateway_status, on: :ok, to: :complete}
  ],
  retries: [%{step: :check_gateway_status, opts: [max_attempts: 5]}],
  entry_steps: [:load_invoice],
  initial_step: :load_invoice,
  entry_step: :load_invoice
}
```

Conditional transitions use the same spec shape. A workflow editor can render
the branch as edge metadata without inspecting step modules:

```elixir
transition :classify,
  on: :ok,
  to: :auto_approve,
  condition: [path: [:routing, :decision], equals: "auto"]

transition :classify, on: :ok, to: :manual_review
```

The normalized spec exposes the condition as data:

```elixir
%SquidMesh.Workflow.Spec{
  transitions: [
    %{
      from: :classify,
      on: :ok,
      to: :auto_approve,
      condition: %{path: [:routing, :decision], equals: "auto"}
    },
    %{from: :classify, on: :ok, to: :manual_review}
  ]
}
```

At runtime, Squid Mesh evaluates conditional transitions in declaration order.
The first matching condition wins; an unconditional transition is the fallback.
Condition `equals` values must be JSON-safe values because the selected route is
persisted in durable run history.

Invalid specs return structured errors:

```elixir
{:error, {:invalid_workflow_spec, errors}} =
  SquidMesh.Workflow.validate_spec(%{
    workflow: "Elixir.System",
    triggers: [],
    payload: [],
    steps: [],
    transitions: [],
    retries: [],
    entry_steps: []
  })

[%{path: [:workflow], code: :invalid_workflow} | _] = errors
```

Serialized module names and string-keyed runtime records are intentionally
rejected. Runtime-authored workflows are still out of scope; host applications
should define workflows as compiled Elixir modules and use `to_spec/1` when
they need a stable data representation for backend-neutral tooling or
distributed workflow planning. `validate_spec/1` checks shape and invariants; it
does not act as a module ownership allowlist.

## Triggers

Triggers define how a workflow run starts.

Supported trigger types:

- `manual()`
- `cron expression, timezone: "Etc/UTC"`
- `cron expression, timezone: "Etc/UTC", idempotency: :return_existing_run`

Trigger names are business-oriented entrypoints such as `:payment_recovery` or
`:invoice_delivery`. The trigger type describes how that entrypoint is invoked.

Current boundary:

- trigger metadata is validated and stored in the workflow definition
- manual triggers are runnable through the public API
- cron activations are delivered by the host scheduler and can start journal
  runs through `SquidMesh.Runtime.Runner.perform/2`

Cron workflow example:

```elixir
defmodule Content.Workflows.PostDailyDigest do
  use SquidMesh.Workflow

  workflow do
    trigger :daily_digest do
      cron "0 9 * * 1-5", timezone: "Etc/UTC", idempotency: :return_existing_run

      payload do
        field :feed_url, :string, default: "https://example.com/feed.xml"
        field :discord_webhook_url, :string
        field :posted_on, :string, default: {:today, :iso8601}
      end
    end

    step :fetch_feed, Content.Steps.FetchFeed
    step :build_digest, Content.Steps.BuildDigest
    step :post_to_discord, Content.Steps.PostToDiscord,
      retry: [max_attempts: 5, backoff: [type: :exponential, min: 1_000, max: 30_000]]

    transition :fetch_feed, on: :ok, to: :build_digest
    transition :build_digest, on: :ok, to: :post_to_discord
    transition :post_to_discord, on: :ok, to: :complete
  end
end
```

Host-app scheduler example:

```elixir
def handle_cron_tick do
  MyApp.SquidMeshDeliveryAdapter.enqueue_cron(
    SquidMesh.config!(),
    MyApp.Workflows.DailyStandup,
    :daily_standup,
    signal_id: "daily-standup:2026-05-15T09:00:00Z",
    intended_window: %{
      start_at: "2026-05-15T09:00:00Z",
      end_at: "2026-05-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  )
end
```

Current cron boundary:

- Squid Mesh declares cron intent in the workflow DSL
- the host app performs the actual recurring scheduling
- cron workflow registration is static at boot today
- delivered cron payloads start runs through the configured runtime, which is
  the Jido journal runtime by default

Scheduled workflow steps receive scheduler metadata through the durable run
context, not through the workflow payload contract. If the host scheduler passes
`signal_id` and `intended_window`, the first step can read them from
`context.state.schedule`. This is the value to use for windowed work because it
represents the logical schedule period even when job delivery is delayed.

Cron trigger idempotency is opt-in. Add `idempotency: :return_existing_run`
when a duplicate delivery of the same scheduled activation should return the
first run instead of creating another run. `idempotency: :skip_duplicate` is
also accepted for hosts that want to describe the duplicate decision as a skip.
Both strategies require a stable scheduler identity: pass `signal_id`, or pass
an `intended_window` with `start_at` and `end_at` so Squid Mesh can derive one.
When idempotency is enabled, the persisted schedule context includes
`idempotency` and `idempotency_key`. Squid Mesh uses that stable schedule
identity to fence duplicate starts for the same workflow and trigger across the
configured durable storage backend.

## Payload

The trigger `payload` block defines the run input contract.

```elixir
payload do
  field :account_id, :string
  field :invoice_id, :string
  field :prompt_date, :string, default: {:today, :iso8601}
end
```

Supported field types today:

- `:string`
- `:integer`
- `:float`
- `:boolean`
- `:map`
- `:list`
- `:atom`

Supported defaults today:

- literal values that match the declared field type
- `{:today, :iso8601}` for ISO-8601 dates generated at run creation time

Payload validation runs before the run is persisted.

## Steps

Each `step` is declared in the workflow spec and is either:

- a native Squid Mesh step module that performs domain work
- a built-in primitive supplied by the runtime
- a raw `Jido.Action` module used as an explicit interop path

Module step:

```elixir
step :load_invoice, Billing.Steps.LoadInvoice
```

Native step modules use Squid Mesh concepts only:

```elixir
defmodule Billing.Steps.LoadInvoice do
  use SquidMesh.Step,
    name: :load_invoice,
    description: "Loads invoice details",
    input_schema: [
      invoice_id: [type: :string, required: true]
    ],
    output_schema: [
      invoice: [type: :map, required: true]
    ]

  @impl true
  def run(%{invoice_id: invoice_id}, %SquidMesh.Step.Context{} = context) do
    {:ok, %{invoice: %{id: invoice_id, run_id: context.run_id}}}
  end
end
```

`SquidMesh.Step.Context` exposes durable Squid Mesh runtime data:

- `run_id`
- `workflow`
- `step`
- `runnable_key`
- `attempt`
- `state`, which includes the original payload merged with accumulated run context

Native steps may return:

- `{:ok, output}` or `{:ok, output, opts}` for success
- `{:error, reason}` for terminal failure that skips workflow retries and follows failure routing
- `{:retry, reason}` or `{:retry, reason, opts}` for retryable failure governed by the workflow retry policy

When `output: :key` is declared on the workflow step, Squid Mesh stores the
native step's returned map under that key after the step returns. The
`output_schema` validates the native step return before that workflow-level
mapping is applied.

Raw `Jido.Action` modules remain supported for advanced interop. They execute
through the same journal-backed runtime, but applications should prefer `use
SquidMesh.Step` for the common authoring path.

## Child Workflow Runs

Native Squid Mesh steps can start another workflow as a durable child run when a
step discovers work that is not known at workflow definition time. Use this for
runtime fan-out where each child needs its own run history, retries,
inspection, cancellation, and replay boundary.

```elixir
defmodule Billing.Steps.StartReceiptDelivery do
  use SquidMesh.Step,
    name: :start_receipt_delivery,
    input_schema: [
      invoice: [type: :map, required: true]
    ]

  @impl true
  def run(%{invoice: invoice}, %SquidMesh.Step.Context{} = context) do
    {:ok, child} =
      SquidMesh.start_child_run(
        context,
        Billing.Workflows.SendReceipt,
        :send_receipt,
        %{invoice_id: invoice.id, customer_id: invoice.customer_id},
        child_key: "receipt:#{invoice.id}",
        metadata: %{invoice_id: invoice.id}
      )

    {:ok, %{receipt_run_id: child.run_id}}
  end
end
```

`child_key` is required. Squid Mesh uses the parent run id, parent step,
child workflow, child trigger, and `child_key` to derive the child identity.
Calling `start_child_run/5` again with the same logical parent and key returns
the existing child instead of creating a duplicate.

If the child workflow has one trigger, `start_child_run/4` can use that default
trigger:

```elixir
SquidMesh.start_child_run(context, Billing.Workflows.SendReceipt, %{invoice_id: invoice.id},
  child_key: "receipt:#{invoice.id}"
)
```

Child runs are normal journal runs with extra lineage:

- the parent run records a `child_run_started` fact for inspection and graph
  tooling
- the child snapshot includes `parent_run` metadata with the parent run id,
  parent step, runnable key, attempt, child key, and caller metadata
- cancellation waits until linked children have actually started, so a parent
  cannot be cancelled halfway through durable child-start repair
- terminal parents reject new child starts, and stale parent step contexts are
  rejected before new lineage is appended

Keep child workflows backend-neutral. Starting children is a workflow runtime
operation; delivery backends such as Bedrock or Oban should remain behind host
adapter boundaries.

Built-in steps:

```elixir
step :wait_for_settlement, :wait, duration: 5_000
step :log_recovery_attempt, :log, message: "Checking gateway status", level: :info
step :wait_for_approval, :pause
approval_step :wait_for_review, output: :approval
```

Built-in step options supported today:

- `:wait` requires `duration`
- `:log` requires `message` and accepts `level`
- `:pause` intentionally stops the run at that step until an operator resumes it
- `approval_step/2` pauses the run for an explicit approve/reject decision and uses `:ok` or `:error` transitions to continue
- `:wait` appends delayed journal continuation so long waits do not block a worker slot
- `:pause` is supported in transition-based workflows; dependency-based workflows cannot declare `:pause`
- `approval_step/2` is also transition-based only; dependency-based workflows cannot declare built-in `:approval` steps

Manual approval example:

```elixir
approval_step :wait_for_approval, output: :approval
step :record_approval, Billing.Steps.RecordApproval,
  input: [:account_id, :approval],
  output: :approval

step :record_rejection, Billing.Steps.RecordRejection,
  input: [:account_id, :approval],
  output: :approval

transition :wait_for_approval, on: :ok, to: :record_approval
transition :wait_for_approval, on: :error, to: :record_rejection
transition :record_approval, on: :ok, to: :complete
transition :record_rejection, on: :ok, to: :complete
```

When a run is paused at an approval step, inspect it as usual and then approve
or reject it through the public API:

```elixir
{:ok, paused_run} = SquidMesh.inspect_run(run_id, include_history: true)
{:ok, approved_run} = SquidMesh.approve_run(run_id, %{actor: "ops_123"})
{:ok, rejected_run} = SquidMesh.reject_run(run_id, %{actor: "ops_456"})
```

With `include_history: true`, the inspected run also exposes `audit_events` so
host apps can show who paused, resumed, approved, or rejected the run and when:

```elixir
Enum.map(paused_run.audit_events, &{&1.type, &1.step})
#=> [{:paused, :wait_for_approval}]
```

Manual-review durability notes:

- `approval_step/2` is only supported in transition-based workflows
- the approval step stays `:running` while the run is `:paused`
- `approve_run/3` completes that step and advances the declared `:ok` path
- `reject_run/3` completes that step and advances the declared `:error` path
- reviewer identity, decision, timestamp, and optional review metadata are persisted in the completed step output and merged run context
- `inspect_run(..., include_history: true)` also returns durable audit events for pause, resume, approval, and rejection actions
- the resolved `:ok` and `:error` targets plus output-mapping metadata are persisted with the paused step so restart or deploy boundaries do not recompute review semantics from the current workflow definition
- host apps should apply the latest Squid Mesh migrations before using pause-resume in existing environments

## Jido Runtime Configuration

Host apps can configure the Jido-native journal runtime once and let public APIs
pick up the runtime, read model, storage adapter, and queue defaults:

```elixir
config :squid_mesh,
  repo: MyApp.Repo,
  queue: "default"
```

With those settings, workflow code can use the same public calls without
threading journal options through every boundary:

```elixir
{:ok, started} = SquidMesh.start_run(MyWorkflow, %{account_id: "acct_123"})
{:ok, snapshot} = SquidMesh.inspect_run(started.run_id)
{:ok, snapshot} = SquidMesh.execute_next(owner_id: "worker-1")
{:ok, summaries} = SquidMesh.list_runs([])
{:ok, workflow_summaries} = SquidMesh.list_runs(workflow: MyWorkflow)

{:ok, replayed} = SquidMesh.replay_run(completed_run_id)

{:ok, cancellable} = SquidMesh.start_run(MyWorkflow, %{account_id: "acct_456"})
{:ok, cancelled} = SquidMesh.cancel_run(cancellable.run_id)
```

When no `journal_storage` is configured, Squid Mesh infers
`{SquidMesh.Runtime.Journal.Storage.Ecto, repo: MyApp.Repo}`. The storage
setting remains intentionally adapter-shaped rather than database-shaped, so
host apps can override it later without changing workflow code. The built-in
Ecto adapter is the recommended starting point for Postgres-compatible Ecto
repos because it persists Jido threads and checkpoints in the host database
through the Squid Mesh migration. Other Jido-compatible stores can be used, but
production adapters should provide ordered per-thread appends, optimistic
conflict detection, and durable checkpoint reads; not every database can provide
those properties without extra coordination. Use `Jido.Storage.ETS` only for
tests and local demos because it is process-local and ephemeral.

Journal-backed `list_runs/2` uses a durable run catalog to list all known runs
without scanning adapter-specific storage internals. Add a `workflow:` filter
when a caller only needs one workflow. Listing returns redacted summaries; call
`inspect_run/2` or `inspect_run_graph/2` with the selected summary's `run_id`
and `queue` when the caller needs full inputs, outputs, attempts, history, or
claim metadata.

Journal cancellation appends a terminal run fact, clears any manual pause state
from the rebuilt projection, and fences stale dispatch claims before they can
complete after cancellation. The `queue` option selects the returned dispatch
projection for inspection; the cancellation boundary is the globally unique
`run_id`.

Journal replay rebuilds the source run from durable journal facts, starts a
fresh journal run with the same trigger and resolved input, and stores
`replayed_from_run_id` on the replayed run's projection. Completed steps marked
`irreversible: true` or `compensatable: false` require
`allow_irreversible: true` before replay can proceed.

Journal snapshots are full-detail operator views. `inspect_run/2` includes the
resolved trigger input on `snapshot.input`; keep secrets out of workflow inputs
or redact them at the host app UI/API boundary.

## Graph Inspection

Use `inspect_run/2` when application code needs the factual run snapshot. Use
`inspect_run_graph/2` when a CLI, dashboard, or workflow editor needs a
node-and-edge view without reverse-engineering step history:

```elixir
{:ok, graph} = SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph(run_id)
```

For the stable host UI map shape, see the
[graph inspection contract](graph_inspection.md).

For executable approval, recovery, dependency, saga, and scheduled workflow
examples, see [reference workflows](reference_workflows.md).

The graph is derived from the same durable state as `inspect_run/2`. The default
Jido-native read model rebuilds graph state from journal projections and infers
Ecto storage from the configured repo. To override storage or queue for a
specific call, pass the same projection options used for inspection:

```elixir
{:ok, graph} =
  SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph(run_id,
    journal_storage: storage,
    queue: "default"
  )
```

The returned shape is stable across backend execution choices:

```elixir
%SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection{
  run_id: run_id,
  source: :read_model,
  status: :running,
  current_node_id: "send_email",
  current_node_ids: ["send_email"],
  nodes: [
    %SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection.Node{
      id: "load_invoice",
      status: :completed
    }
  ],
  edges: [
    %SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection.Edge{
      id: "load_invoice:ok:send_email",
      from: "load_invoice",
      to: "send_email",
      type: :transition,
      outcome: :ok,
      status: :selected
    }
  ]
}
```

Conditional transition edges include their condition and use a deterministic
edge id that distinguishes multiple `from` and `on` edges within the same
workflow spec:

```elixir
%SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection.Edge{
  id: "classify:ok:auto_approve:condition:0",
  from: "classify",
  to: "auto_approve",
  type: :transition,
  outcome: :ok,
  condition: %{path: [:routing, :decision], equals: "auto"},
  status: :selected
}
```

Completed steps also persist the selected transition decision. Editors can use
that durable fact to explain why one branch was selected and sibling branches
were skipped after a restart or journal replay.

By default, graph inspection returns topology, run status, node status, edge
status, active node ids, and sanitized projection anomalies. `current_node_id`
is the first active node for simple callers; `current_node_ids` and each node's
`current?` flag preserve parallel runnable nodes in dependency workflows. Step
inputs, outputs, errors, recovery metadata, manual-state metadata, and attempt
details are a privileged history surface because they can contain host-domain
sensitive data. Request those fields explicitly:

```elixir
{:ok, graph_with_details} =
  SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph(run_id, include_history: true)
```

Authorize and redact graph output before exposing it outside trusted operator
surfaces. If the workflow module can no longer be loaded, Squid Mesh still
returns any durable node state it can infer from the run, but `edges` is empty
because edge topology belongs to the workflow definition.

Transition edges are marked `:selected` when durable step state proves the
outcome path was taken, `:skipped` when another terminal outcome won, and
`:pending` while the source step has not reached a terminal step status.
Dependency edges are marked `:selected` once the dependency completed,
`:pending` while it is still waiting or running, and `:blocked` after a failed
dependency.

Node statuses use the same durable evidence: `:waiting` means no runnable work
has been recorded for the node, `:pending` means work is visible or scheduled,
`:running` means a worker has an active claim, `:retrying` means a failed
attempt scheduled a retry, `:paused` means manual intervention is required, and
`:completed` or `:failed` mean durable terminal step state exists.

## Local Repo Transactions

Use `transaction: :repo` when one module step needs to run several same-process
host repo writes under one local Ecto transaction:

```elixir
step :post_local_ledger_entries, Billing.Steps.PostLocalLedgerEntries,
  transaction: :repo
```

This option is intentionally narrower than the durable workflow. It wraps only
the custom action's `run/2` callback in `config.repo.transaction/1`. If that
callback returns `{:error, reason}` or raises, the local repo writes made inside
the callback roll back and Squid Mesh then records the failed step attempt in
its normal durable history.

The boundary is not a distributed transaction:

- Squid Mesh still persists run, step, attempt, retry, and dispatch state after
  the action returns
- downstream steps and saga compensation callbacks are outside the local
  transaction
- external systems called by the action are not atomically reversible
- built-in steps cannot declare `transaction: :repo`
- transactional steps run in the worker process so Ecto can use the same
  checked-out transaction connection

Use this for small local database groups such as "insert a parent row plus
children" or "reserve and capture two local ledger records". Use saga
compensation or explicit `:error` transitions for work that crosses process,
queue, service, or workflow-step boundaries.

## Irreversible Steps

Use recovery markers when a step performs a side effect that should not be
treated as safely repeatable or undoable.

```elixir
step(:capture_payment, Billing.Steps.CapturePayment, irreversible: true)
step(:send_receipt, Billing.Steps.SendReceipt, compensatable: false)
```

`irreversible: true` means the step's effect cannot be undone in the workflow's
domain. Squid Mesh treats it as non-compensatable. `compensatable: false` is for
steps that may not be strictly irreversible but still have no reliable
application-owned compensation path.

Both markers produce the same replay safety behavior:

- `inspect_run(..., include_history: true)` includes each step's `recovery`
  policy
- `explain_run/2` removes `:replay_run` from terminal next actions after a
  completed marked step and reports the blocking step in `details.replay`
- `replay_run/2` returns
  `{:error, {:unsafe_replay, details}}` by default after a completed marked step
- `replay_run(run_id, allow_irreversible: true)` is the explicit operator
  override when re-execution has been reviewed and accepted

These markers do not provide exactly-once delivery or external compensation.
They keep Squid Mesh honest about recovery policy so a replay cannot silently
repeat a payment capture, notification, or other non-compensatable effect.

## Saga Compensation

Use `compensate: SomeAction` when a completed step has a domain-level inverse
operation that should run if a later step fails and the workflow cannot continue.
This is rollback, not same-step fallback. Same-step fallback stays modeled as an
`:error` transition.

```elixir
step :reserve_inventory, Billing.Steps.ReserveInventory,
  compensate: Billing.Steps.ReleaseInventory

step :authorize_payment, Billing.Steps.AuthorizePayment,
  compensate: Billing.Steps.VoidAuthorization

step :capture_payment, Billing.Steps.CapturePayment, retry: [max_attempts: 2]

transition :reserve_inventory, on: :ok, to: :authorize_payment
transition :authorize_payment, on: :ok, to: :capture_payment
transition :capture_payment, on: :ok, to: :complete
```

When `:capture_payment` exhausts its retry policy and has no `:error`
transition, Squid Mesh compensates previously completed compensatable steps in
reverse completion order. In this example it voids the payment authorization,
then releases inventory. Failed steps are not compensated because their forward
effect did not complete.

Compensation callbacks use the same step module contract as normal workflow
steps. They receive the original payload, current run context, the completed
step's input and output, and the terminal failure:

```elixir
def run(%{step: %{output: %{inventory_reservation: reservation}}}, _context) do
  {:ok, %{released_inventory: Map.put(reservation, :status, "released")}}
end
```

`inspect_run(..., include_history: true)` exposes compensation status and output
under each completed step's `recovery.compensation` field. Compensation callbacks
are not governed by the forward step's retry policy; forward retries exhaust
before rollback starts, and callback failures are persisted under
`recovery.compensation` for inspection. Write callbacks to be idempotent so a
host app can safely redeliver or repair failed compensation work.

## Compensation And Undo Routes

Error transitions can declare whether the routed recovery step is compensation
or undo:

```elixir
transition(:capture_payment, on: :error, to: :issue_credit, recovery: :compensation)
transition(:reserve_inventory, on: :error, to: :release_inventory, recovery: :undo)
```

Use `recovery: :compensation` when the next step reconciles or finishes partial
work with a forward action, such as issuing a credit after a payment capture
cannot continue. Use `recovery: :undo` when the next step reverses application-
owned local work, such as releasing a reservation that the workflow can still
control.

The marker does not change retry behavior. Squid Mesh still retries the failed
step first when a retry policy exists, then routes through the error transition
only after retries are exhausted. When the route is chosen,
`inspect_run(..., include_history: true)` exposes it in the failed step's
`recovery.failure` field and adds an audit event:

```elixir
%{
  failure: %{strategy: :compensation, target: :issue_credit}
}
```

Audit event types are `:compensation_routed` and `:undo_routed`, with the
target step in event metadata.

## Step Modules

Custom steps should usually use `SquidMesh.Step` and return workflow output in a
plain map.

```elixir
defmodule Billing.Steps.CheckGatewayStatus do
  use SquidMesh.Step,
    name: :check_gateway_status,
    description: "Checks gateway state",
    input_schema: [
      invoice: [type: :map, required: true],
      gateway_url: [type: :string, required: true]
    ],
    output_schema: [
      gateway_check: [type: :map, required: true]
    ]

  @impl true
  def run(
        %{invoice: invoice, gateway_url: gateway_url},
        %SquidMesh.Step.Context{}
      ) do
    case SquidMesh.Tools.invoke(SquidMesh.Tools.HTTP, %{method: :get, url: gateway_url}) do
      {:ok, result} ->
        {:ok, %{gateway_check: %{invoice_id: invoice.id, status: result.payload.body}}}

      {:error, error} ->
        {:error, SquidMesh.Tools.Error.to_map(error)}
    end
  end
end
```

Step result contract:

- success: `{:ok, map()}`
- failure: `{:error, map()}`
- retryable failure: `{:retry, reason}` or `{:retry, reason, opts}`

## Data Flow Between Steps

Each run starts with its validated payload.

When a step succeeds:

- Squid Mesh merges the returned map into the run context
- the next step receives the original payload merged with the accumulated context

That means later steps can use values produced by earlier steps without manual
state persistence in the host application.

If you want a step to consume only a subset of the available data, declare an
explicit input mapping. A list selects top-level keys without renaming them:

```elixir
step :load_account, Billing.Steps.LoadAccount, input: [:account_id], output: :account
step :send_email, Billing.Steps.SendEmail, input: [:account, :invoice_id], output: :delivery
```

In that example:

- `:load_account` receives only `%{account_id: ...}`
- its returned map is stored under `:account`
- `:send_email` receives only `%{account: ..., invoice_id: ...}`
- its returned map is stored under `:delivery`

Use a keyword mapping when a step should receive renamed values from nested
paths in the accumulated payload and context:

```elixir
step :prepare_notification, Billing.Steps.PrepareNotification,
  after: [:load_account, :load_invoice],
  input: [
    account_id: [:account, :id],
    invoice_id: [:invoice, :id],
    account_tier: [:account, :tier]
  ]
```

In that example, `:prepare_notification` receives only:

```elixir
%{
  account_id: "acct_123",
  invoice_id: "inv_456",
  account_tier: "standard"
}
```

If any named path is absent, Squid Mesh returns a structured
`:missing_input_path` error before the step begins execution.

Current boundary:

- run context is still a flat merged map
- explicit `input: [:key, ...]` lets a step declare which top-level keys it consumes
- explicit `input: [name: [:path, ...]]` lets a step consume named values from nested context
- explicit `output: :key` lets a step namespace its returned map under one top-level key
- dependency-based workflows with parallel branches should still emit disjoint top-level keys unless they intentionally namespace outputs
- if multiple parallel branches write the same key, the result is not a stable workflow contract today

## Dependency-Based Steps

Steps can also wait on explicit dependencies instead of success transitions:

```elixir
step :load_account, Billing.Steps.LoadAccount
step :load_invoice, Billing.Steps.LoadInvoice
step :prepare_notification, Billing.Steps.PrepareNotification,
  after: [:load_account, :load_invoice]
```

Choose dependency-based steps when you want to model prerequisites and joins.
They can still express a sequential chain such as `step_2 after: [:step_1]` and
`step_3 after: [:step_2]`, but if the workflow is only a straight ordered path,
`transition/2` is usually the clearer fit because it states the next step
directly.

Use `transition/2` when the workflow is a single ordered path and each step
chooses the next step by outcome. Use `after: [...]` when a step should wait
for one or more prerequisite steps, especially when multiple root steps fan in
to a join step.

In the example above, `:load_account` and `:load_invoice` are independent root
steps. Squid Mesh does not need a transition between them because neither one
depends on the other. They may become visible independently, and
`:prepare_notification` becomes runnable only after both have completed.

`after: [...]` makes a step runnable only after every named dependency
completes successfully. Omit the option entirely for root steps; `after: []` is
not valid because it changes execution semantics without adding a dependency
edge. Dependency workflows do not mix with `transition/2` in this slice.

### Fan-Out And Fan-In Contract

Dependency-based workflows model static graph fan-out and fan-in. A root step is
any declared step without `after: [...]`. Multiple root steps may be scheduled
as independent runnable work for the same run. A join step is any step with one
or more dependencies; it becomes runnable only after every declared dependency
has completed successfully.

Squid Mesh treats Runic-ready work as workflow runnable intent. The journal
runtime persists that intent as durable dispatch entries before workers can
claim it through `SquidMesh.execute_next/1`. The workflow contract is the same
across backends: readiness comes from persisted journal state, not from Oban,
Bedrock, or any other backend's concurrency model.

Sibling behavior:

- sibling root steps may run in either order, or concurrently when the host
  runs multiple journal workers
- a join waits while any dependency is still pending or running
- a join is not scheduled after a sibling reaches terminal failure
- a sibling retry keeps the run in retrying state until the retry is delivered
  and the dependency completes
- cancellation and terminal run transitions prevent newly unlocked join work
  from being dispatched

Inspection and explanation reflect this graph state. With history enabled,
`inspect_run/2` shows declared dependency edges and whether each step is
pending, running, completed, failed, or waiting. `explain_run/2` reports a
waiting join with the dependencies it is waiting on and their current statuses;
once the join is scheduled, the explanation points at the runnable join step
and lists the dependencies that satisfied it.

Current dependency validation requires:

- every `after:` reference names a declared step
- the dependency graph is acyclic
- workflows may define multiple entry steps when dependency execution is used
- `after: []` is rejected because it changes execution semantics without adding an edge
- dependency-based workflows cannot also declare `transition/2`
- dependency-based workflows cannot declare built-in `:pause` or `:approval`
  steps; use transition-based workflows for those manual wait points today

Current execution boundary:

- a step becomes runnable only after every dependency has completed successfully
- multiple ready root steps can be enqueued independently while later phases still respect deterministic dependency order
- the current scheduler resolves dependency readiness from persisted step history after each successful dependency step, so it is intended for small and medium graph workflows
- downstream work is only enqueued from a locked run-progression boundary, so a sibling terminal failure prevents later dispatch

## Transitions

Transitions define the path through the workflow.

```elixir
transition :check_gateway_status, on: :ok, to: :notify_customer
transition :check_gateway_status, on: :error, to: :notify_operator
transition :notify_customer, on: :ok, to: :complete
```

Current workflow validation requires:

- at least one step
- exactly one trigger
- exactly one workflow entry step for transition-based workflows
- dependency-based workflows expose `entry_steps` plus `initial_step`; the singular `entry_step` is `nil`
- transitions only use supported outcomes: `:ok` and `:error`
- transitions reference known steps
- each `{from, on}` pair is declared at most once

## Retries And Backoff

Retry policy lives on the step that owns the work:

```elixir
step :check_gateway_status, Billing.Steps.CheckGatewayStatus,
  retry: [max_attempts: 5, backoff: [type: :exponential, min: 1_000, max: 30_000]]
```

Supported retry options today:

- `max_attempts`
- `backoff: [type: :exponential, min: ..., max: ...]`

Squid Mesh resolves workflow retry policy and appends the next journal dispatch
attempt with its computed visibility time. If a step also declares an
`on: :error` transition, Squid Mesh takes that route only after retries are
exhausted.

## Starting Runs

If a workflow defines a single trigger, the short path is:

```elixir
SquidMesh.start_run(Billing.Workflows.PaymentRecovery, %{
  account_id: account_id,
  invoice_id: invoice_id,
  attempt_id: attempt_id,
  gateway_url: gateway_url
})
```

If you want to name the trigger explicitly:

```elixir
SquidMesh.start_run(Billing.Workflows.PaymentRecovery, :payment_recovery, %{
  account_id: account_id,
  invoice_id: invoice_id,
  attempt_id: attempt_id,
  gateway_url: gateway_url
})
```

## Current Boundaries

The current workflow contract is intentionally smaller than a full graph engine.

Supported today:

- one trigger per workflow
- sequential transitions with explicit `:ok` and `:error` outcomes
- conditional transition branches with an unconditional fallback
- dependency-based joins with `after: [...]`
- durable retries and replay
- built-in `:wait`, `:log`, `:pause`, and `:approval` steps

Not implemented today:

- parallel dispatch of multiple ready steps
- deferred continuation decisions
- dynamic cron registration after boot
- custom reclaim logic for interrupted in-flight step ownership
