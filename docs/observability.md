# Observability

Squid Mesh is observable through durable runtime state first. Host applications
inspect the journal-backed read models, graph output, explanation diagnostics,
and their own worker logs or metrics.

Squid Mesh does not currently expose a public `:telemetry` event contract under
the `[:squid_mesh, ...]` prefix. Treat telemetry event names and metric labels
as host-app concerns until a dedicated runtime telemetry API exists.

## Runtime State Surfaces

Use these public APIs as the stable observability boundary:

- `SquidMesh.list_runs/2` - redacted run index rows for dashboards and queue
  views.
- `SquidMesh.inspect_run/2` - one run's durable state, including attempts,
  visible work, scheduled work, expired claims, manual state, context, and
  anomalies.
- `SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph/2` - graph-oriented node and edge state for UI
  builders.
- `SquidMesh.explain_run/2` - operator-facing reason, details, evidence, and
  next actions.

`list_runs/2` intentionally stays narrow. It exposes lookup and status fields
without attempt inputs, outputs, errors, claim metadata, or idempotency keys.
Use `inspect_run/2` only after selecting a specific run and applying the host
app's authorization rules.

## Redaction And Field Selection

Treat Squid Mesh observability data as three tiers:

| Tier | Examples | Suggested use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Index-safe | `run_id`, workflow, queue, status, terminal status, indexed time | Run lists, dashboards, queue counters. |
| Operator detail | reason, visible/scheduled attempt counts, next visibility time, manual step, anomaly count | Support views and incident pages after authorization. |
| Sensitive detail | run input, durable context, attempt input/output/error, idempotency keys, claim IDs, owner IDs, manual metadata | Privileged audit views only, with host redaction. |

`inspect_run/2` and `inspect_run_graph/2` can expose host-domain data because
step inputs, outputs, errors, manual metadata, and durable context come from the
embedding application. Squid Mesh cannot know which fields are customer data,
provider responses, tokens, or internal notes. Apply an allow-list at the HTTP,
LiveView, CLI, or API boundary instead of serializing the full snapshot by
default.

For example, an operator summary can keep runtime state while dropping step
payloads:

```elixir
def operator_summary(snapshot) do
  manual_state = snapshot.manual_state || %{}

  %{
    run_id: snapshot.run_id,
    workflow: snapshot.workflow,
    queue: snapshot.queue,
    status: snapshot.status,
    reason: snapshot.reason,
    visible_attempt_count: length(snapshot.visible_attempts),
    scheduled_attempt_count: length(snapshot.scheduled_attempts),
    next_visible_at: snapshot.next_visible_at,
    manual_step: Map.get(manual_state, :step) || Map.get(manual_state, "step"),
    anomaly_count: length(snapshot.anomalies)
  }
end
```

For graph views, prefer `inspect_run_graph/2` without `include_history: true`
unless the viewer needs input, output, error, manual-state, or attempt detail.
When history is enabled, redact each node's `input`, `output`, `error`,
`manual_state`, and `attempts` fields before exposing the payload outside a
trusted operator surface.

Use the same rule for metrics and logs: record counts, statuses, queues,
workflow names, and reason categories. Avoid user-provided payload fields,
provider responses, idempotency keys, claim identifiers, and raw errors as
labels or log fields.

## What To Measure

The read model gives host apps enough durable state to derive useful operational
signals:

| Signal | Source | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run counts by workflow, queue, and status | `list_runs/2` | Tracks volume, completion rate, and backlog shape. |
| Visible attempt depth | `inspect_run/2.visible_attempts` | Shows work that workers can claim now. |
| Scheduled attempt depth and next wakeup | `scheduled_attempts`, `next_visible_at` | Shows delayed retries, waits, and future-visible work. |
| Claimed or expired attempts | `attempts`, `expired_claims` | Identifies workers that are busy, stalled, or recoverable. |
| Pending dispatch/results | `pending_dispatches`, `pending_results` | Detects journal facts that need runtime reconciliation. |
| Manual intervention count | `manual_state` and status `:paused` | Drives approval queues and operator SLAs. |
| Terminal outcomes | `terminal?`, `terminal_status` | Tracks completed, failed, cancelled, and replayed work. |
| Runtime anomalies | `anomalies` | Surfaces inconsistent or malformed durable facts. |

For dashboards, start with `list_runs/2`, then inspect selected runs with
history only when the caller needs detailed attempts or audit evidence.

## Operator Explanations

`explain_run/2` is the highest-signal surface for support tooling. It condenses
the inspection snapshot into:

- `reason` - the runtime state category, such as `:attempt_visible`,
  `:attempt_scheduled_for_later`, `:manual_intervention_required`,
  `:expired_claim`, or `:terminal`.
- `summary` and `details` - a short explanation plus structured state.
- `next_actions` - safe host/operator actions, such as waiting for a worker,
  resolving a manual step, recovering an expired claim, or inspecting a
  terminal run.
- `evidence` - thread revisions, attempt counts, planned/applied runnable keys,
  manual state, next visibility time, and anomalies.

Use this for incident pages, CLI output, and support views where raw journal
facts would be too noisy.

## Graph Output

`inspect_run_graph/2` presents the same durable state as workflow nodes and
edges. It is useful when a host UI needs to show:

- current nodes
- completed, pending, retrying, failed, skipped, and paused nodes
- selected transition edges
- dependency edges and pending joins
- manual-state detail when history is included

For JSON or LiveView boundaries, call `SquidMesh.Runs.GraphInspection.to_map/1`
after applying the host app's authorization and redaction policy. See
[Graph inspection contract](graph_inspection.md) for the stable map shape.

## Logs

Squid Mesh emits application logs only for explicit built-in `:log` workflow
steps. It does not currently attach automatic logger metadata such as `run_id`,
`workflow`, `step`, or `attempt` to every runtime log.

If a host app needs correlated logs, wrap worker execution and host boundaries
with its own logger metadata:

```elixir
Logger.metadata(queue: queue, worker: worker_id)
SquidMesh.execute_next(queue: queue, owner_id: worker_id)
```

For step-specific external calls, prefer logging at the host boundary or inside
native `SquidMesh.Step` modules, and avoid logging secrets, claim tokens,
payloads, or raw provider responses.

## Host Telemetry

Host applications can still emit their own telemetry around Squid Mesh calls:

```elixir
:telemetry.span(
  [:my_app, :squid_mesh, :execute_next],
  %{queue: queue, worker: worker_id},
  fn ->
    result = SquidMesh.execute_next(queue: queue, owner_id: worker_id)
    {result, %{result: elem(result, 0)}}
  end
)
```

Keep host telemetry labels low-cardinality. Good labels include queue, workflow,
status, and result category. Avoid `run_id`, claim tokens, idempotency keys,
raw errors, or user-provided payload fields as metric labels.
