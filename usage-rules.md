# Squid Mesh Usage Rules

Use these rules when building host apps with Squid Mesh or changing Squid Mesh
itself.

## Core Model

- Squid Mesh is an embedded durable workflow runtime for Elixir applications.
- Workflow authors define compiled Elixir workflow modules with triggers,
  payload contracts, steps, transitions, waits, approvals, retries, and
  recovery routes.
- The Jido-native journal runtime is the source of truth for run, dispatch,
  attempt, manual-control, and terminal facts.
- Host workers provide execution capacity by calling `SquidMesh.execute_next/1`.
- Optional schedulers can deliver cron payloads through
  `SquidMesh.Runtime.Runner.perform/2`.
- Optional backend adapters, such as the Bedrock example, can own durable
  delivery and lease mechanics without changing workflow modules.

## Rules To Follow

- Prefer `use SquidMesh.Step` for custom workflow steps.
- Use raw `Jido.Action` modules only for explicit interop.
- Keep workflow definitions backend-neutral.
- Keep delivery and job boundaries thin; call host-owned modules that wrap
  Squid Mesh public APIs.
- Use `SquidMesh.list_runs/2` for index views and
  `SquidMesh.inspect_run/2`, `SquidMesh.inspect_run_graph/2`, or
  `SquidMesh.explain_run/2` for details.
- Add idempotency keys or domain duplicate detection to side-effecting steps.
- Treat external exactly-once behavior as out of scope for Squid Mesh.

## Rules To Avoid

- Do not configure `:executor` for step execution.
- Do not configure `:stale_step_timeout`.
- Do not use or document `:runtime_tables`.
- Do not deliver step or compensation payloads through
  `SquidMesh.Runtime.Runner.perform/2`.
- Do not make workflow modules depend on Bedrock, Oban, or another backend's
  APIs.
- Do not use `String.to_atom/1` on external input or persisted untrusted data.
